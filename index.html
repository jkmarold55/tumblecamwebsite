        <h1>Overview</h1>

        <p><b>TumbleCam</b> is a digital camera that takes photographs and uploads them to Tumblr. When the shutter is pressed on the camera, a picture is taken and then uploaded to Dropbox, then it is transfered from there to the Tumblr page, where it is added to the feed.</p>


      

        <h2>Materials</h2>

        <p>All materials that we used to build the camera are accompanied by Amazon links. <i><b>Note:</b> The links are not affiliate linked.</i></p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Raspberry Pi 3</b> Model B</b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-RASPBERRYPI3-MODB-1GB-Model-Motherboard/dp/B01CD5VC92/"> Purchase</a></li>
          <ul>
            <li>The Model B edition of the Raspberry Pi is camera-sized and has WiFi capabilities, allowing for an untethered, mobile camera.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Raspberry Pi</b> Camera Module V2<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Camera-Module-Megapixel/dp/B01ER2SKFS"> Purchase</a></li>
          <ul>
            <li>After experimenting with a larger camera, the V2 was chosen because it was low profile (keeping the camera profile small) and it had excellent quality. The images come out at a crisp 1080p.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>NovoBeam NBP-3000</b> External Battery<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Novobeam-Ultra-Compact-Waterproof-Dustproof-Portable/dp/B00K3EUE90"> Purchase</a></li>
          <ul>
            <li>While the cylindrical shape was awkward, it suited the project's purposes because it was tin enough to simply be tethered to the side of the camera with velcro or even be used as a hand grip if mounted below the camera.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>MicroSD Card</b> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sandisk-Ultra-Micro-UHS-I-Adapter/dp/B073K14CVB/"> Purchase</a></li>
          <ul>
            <li>We recommend a 16GB SD card because the images will be stored locally as well as in the cloud for redundancy. More available space will allow more images to be taken before having to go into the project files and manually delete them.</li>
            <li><b>Raspbian</b> is the operating system of choice. It is easy to use, and simple to set up.<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/"> Download</a></li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>UCTRONICS UC-430</b>3.5" Touch Display</li>

        </ul>

        <p>These are dangerous goodies though, and we need to make sure email addresses don't get mangled:</p>

        <h2>Math is hard, let's go shopping</h2>

        <p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

        <p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit<br>
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet<br>
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum<br>
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

        <pre>             ,-.
    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )
   \ |  ,.&gt;-(   )-&lt;
    \|,' (   )-(   )
     Y ___`-'   `-'
     |/__/   `-'
     |
     |
     |    -hrr-
  ___|_____________
</pre>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Table for two</h2>

        <table>
          <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Rank</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
        <td>Tom Preston-Werner</td>
        <td>Awesome</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
        <td>Albert Einstein</td>
        <td>Nearly as awesome</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
